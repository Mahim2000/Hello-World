# OUTDATED COMPARED TO THE MASTER BRANCH

## C++ version of the code added in this branch

### Given below is the Original README.MD file of the Master Branch

# Hello World (My First Repo)
This is my first ever Repository on Github, where I pushed multiple test commits to see how things actually work.  
 
[`LATEST UPDATE`]: The hello-world.java file was merged from the branch named "Java-Version-Add" in the same way like hello-world.html. The difference is that the branch "Java-Version-Add" still exists and that branch was pushed in the Remote Repo as well before merging with the Master Branch.

[`UPDATE`]: The hello-world.html wasn't added normally. Infact the master branch was locally branched to another branch called "HTML-Version-Add", and the .html version was added.  
Later on the "HTML-Version-Add" branch was Merged with the Master branch locally, with the "HTML-Version-Add" branch being deleted and pushed in the Remote Repo.


### This Repo basically has 4 files (made in C, Python, HTML and Java). The ".c", ".py", ".html" and ".java" files give the output:

```  

Hello World!
This is a message from Mahim~

```  
There's even a ".gitignore" file which ignores a secret-folder and a secret-file.txt that resides in my local repo

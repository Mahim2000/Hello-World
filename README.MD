# Hello World (My First Repo)
This is my first ever Repository on Github, where I pushed multiple test commits to see how things actually work. Haven't done any merging or branching yet (as of 11th October, 2023), which I will learn later down the line.

### This Repo basically has 2 files. One made in C and the other in Python. Both the ".c" and ".py" file gives the output:

```  

Hello World!
This is a message from Mahim~

```  
There's even a ".gitignore" file which ignores a secret-folder and a secret-file.txt that resides in my local repo

## Java Version of Hello World is added on this Branch of the original repo.
## Original Repo README.MD below.

# Hello World (My First Repo)
This is my first ever Repository on Github, where I pushed multiple test commits to see how things actually work.  
 

[`UPDATE`]: The hello-world.html wasn't added normally. Infact the master branch was locally branched to another branch called "HTML-Version-Add", and the .html version was added.  
Later on the "HTML-Version-Add" branch was Merged with the Master branch locally, with the "HTML-Version-Add" branch being deleted and pushed in the Remote Repo.


### This Repo basically has 3 files (made in C, Python and HTML). The ".c", ".py" and ".html" file gives the output:

```  

Hello World!
This is a message from Mahim~

```  
There's even a ".gitignore" file which ignores a secret-folder and a secret-file.txt that resides in my local repo
